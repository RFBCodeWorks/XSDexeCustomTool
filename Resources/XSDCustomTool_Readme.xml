<XsdCustomTool_HelpFile>
    <!-- 
	This XML file is meant to act as a help guide for working with the XSDCustomTool extension.
        
    Files output by the CustomTool:
    - this help file
    - [InputFileName]_parameters.xml              <This is the parameter file that gets fed into XSD.exe when generating the output class.>
    - [InputFileName]_AutoGenerated.[languageExtension]   <Example> InputFile_AutoGenerated.cs </Example>
	- [InputFileName]_HelperClass.[languageExtension]   <Example> InputFile_HelperClass.cs </Example>
    
    Th "_parameters.xml" file will be used when the extension runs XSD.exe as a way to pass parameters into the extension to determine how it writes the output class / dataset. 
	Customize this file as needed for generating the Class / Dataset you desire. 

    For more info, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/xml-schema-definition-tool-xsd-exe
	
	Please report any issues here. Help is needed to implement functionality for JS, VB, and J# languages (which are all already supported by XSD.exe).
