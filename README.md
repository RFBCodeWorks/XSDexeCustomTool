# XSDexeCustomTool
This VS extension is essentially a wrapper for Microsoft's XSD.exe tool.
Microsoft themselves use XSD.exe for the default XSD CustomTool (MSDataSetGenerator) assigned to .XSD files in Visual Studio.

The idea behind  this tool is that MSDataSetGenerator does not provide any user customizability, and only generates DataSet style files.
For the projects I was working on, DataSets didn't make sense since these were all one-off parameters for a settings file. 
Frankly, I got tired of regenerating the files using command prompt, and found that the parameter file that gets fed into XSD.exe doesn't  
allow full use of the capabilities. Thus this  project was born.

# What It Does
- At its heart, this is a SingleFileGenerator that passes the assigned XSD file into XSD.exe and returns the resulting file.
- Two files will always be generated when the XSD is updated:
   - {InputFileName}_Parameters.xml  -> This file is read as an options file to configure how you want auto-generated code to look.
   - {InputFileName}_Autogenerated.cs -> This file is the file generated by XSD.exe. Note that the file extension changes depending on the output language.
- Two additional files get generated only if they are missing on disk.
   - {InputFileName}_Autogenerated_Supplement.cs
      - xsd.exe generates partial classes that do not include constructors. 
      - This supplement evaluates the  file xsd.exe churns out, then builds itself  in  a similar fashion, but it includes the constructors and a way to set  the base values for all the properties.
   - {InputFileName}_HelperClass.cs
      - Since the output of xsd.exe is quite ugly, this class is created as a wrapper for that class.
      - This also includes method for serializing and deserializing (saving/loading) from a file.
      
      
# Looking Forward
Currently, I am only writing in C#, which is also the default output language of xsd.exe, but xsd.exe does support VB, J#, and JS as well.
If you would like to use this tool for those other languages, I have put the framework in place, but would greatly appreciate some help getting those generators set up!
